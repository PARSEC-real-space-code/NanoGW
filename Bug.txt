Bug:
1.
There are some problems running rgwbs.in_mix, rgwbs.in_rpa, rgwbs.in_tdlda. 
The program stucks after printing: 
" 
allocate(k_tmp(nbuff_max)), where nbuff_max =           20 
k_tmp(:)%nblock_max = nbuff =        50000 
call k_integrate 
" 
Sometimes the program does not stuck and seems to get correct results. 
The program does not stuck for rgwbs.in_hf and rgwbs.in_xhf.
